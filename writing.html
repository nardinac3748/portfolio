            <h2>Writing Skills</h2>
            <p>As a communications major, I have spent plenty of time writing and editing work. Below is some of the work I have done for my classes.</p>

                    <a href="files/Social-Media-Advertising.pdf"><h3>Social Media Advertising</h3></a>
                    <p>This is more of an essay style writing focused on how social media has impacted the world of advertising. It displays my knowledge of analyzing social media.</p>

                    <a href="files/Plain-Language.pdf"><h3>Plain Language</h3></a>
                    <p>For my professional editing and publishing class, we had to write a "book chapter" in a blog style about something important to editing. I chose to write about plain language.</p>

                <form class="writing">
                    <a href="files/Journalism-Final.pdf"><h3>Journalism Story</h3></a>
                    <p>I also took part in a beginning journalism class, where I practiced interviewing, storytelling, and writing in AP style. This is one of my news stories I worked on throughout the semester.</p>

                    <a href="files/Creative-Writing-Portfolio.pdf"><h3>Creative Writing Portfolio</h3></a>
                    <p>My creative writing class taught me a lot about storytelling. This is just a few of the samples of writing that I did over the course of the semester.</p>

                    <a href="files/Avatar-Feminism.pdf"><h3>Feminism in Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3></a>
                    <p>This paper was written for a gender studies class, where I used my vast knowledge of the show to demonstrate my ability to analyze themes in media. It is more essay styled compared to some previous works.</p>
