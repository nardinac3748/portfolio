            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Adam Nardin, and welcome to my portfolio. I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, majoring in Communication Studies and minoring in Multimedia Communication.</p>
            <p>This portfolio was entirely designed and coded by myself, showcasing my web design and html/css skills. It includes tabs for various pages if you want to check out my work, including graphic/web design, video editing, and writing abilities.</p>
            <p>I am still a college student, so I am always learning and developing my skills. I am seeking internships with businesses where I can learn more while simultaneously bringing my knowledge and skills to your business, a mutually beneficial decision. That being said, my contact information is down in the footer of this website, so feel free to contact me about job opportunities!</p>
